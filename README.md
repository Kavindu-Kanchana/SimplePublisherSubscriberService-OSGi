# SimplePublisherSubscriberService-OSGi

## Project Overview

`SimplePublisherSubscriberService-OSGi` is an OSGi-based project that implements a simple Publisher-Subscriber model using Eclipse EE. This project demonstrates how different services can communicate within an OSGi framework using a publisher and subscriber setup. The service is designed to manage a Doctor Payment Management System in a Medical Center, calculating doctors' monthly salaries based on their basic salary, overtime rate, and hours worked.

## Features

- **Doctor Payment Management Service**: 
  - Takes inputs such as Doctorâ€™s Name, Mobile Number, Specialization, Basic Salary, Overtime rate per hour, and Number of Overtime hours worked.
  - Calculates the monthly salary for each doctor.
  - Computes the total amount that the Medical Center should pay for all doctors.

## Creating a New Configuration File

### For DoctorPaymentPublisher

1. **Create a new OSGi Configuration File**:
   - From the Bundles view in Eclipse, select `DoctorPaymentPublisher` from the Workspace.

### For DoctorPaymentSubscriber
